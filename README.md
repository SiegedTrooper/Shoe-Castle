# War of the Martians

In the future, Mars has been colonized. Those who settled on Mars long ago have physically evolved to live on the planet. Their society has those who're pure blood (those who can live without life support) and those who need artificial environments to sustain their living, also known as colonists. A separtist faction has splintered from the pure ones and vie over the surface. You're a local militia commander of colonist who must keep your people safe.
